# Vote #10: Delist Helsing hiring posts

**Opened:** <2026-01-27> by cafkafk **Closed:** <2026-01-28> **Status:** ✅ Accepted

**Proposal**: Upon 4/7 approval, we should hide https://discourse.nixos.org/t/helsing-is-hiring-nixos-engineers/74758. We should have a unified policy towards defense contractors. While one can argue about relative harm, it is much cleaner, and much less geopolitically contentious to have a blanket ban on defense contractors. Regardless of such a policy, to keep this situation balanced, considering previous actions towards Anduril, we should not allow Helsing posting at the current time.


*Notice: the post was de-facto already hidden when this vote concluded*. @JulienMalka also let the poster know what happened / how their post dissapeared, so they are not left in the dark.

| John  | ❌️ | I do not think we should have a blanket ban.<br><br>I think fully integrated software hardware projects are very important for Nix's success, and because of the nature of global manufacturing, in the richest countries that skews to be weapons manufacturing, for better or worse.<br><br>As to my personal opinion, In the current climate, I fully support Europeans arming themselves. I don't want you to appease the heinousness threats of my country because you are under-armed. (and some other countries too.)<br><br>When the SC went to ban the Anduril job posting before. I did indeed say this is bad because we have no clear rules --- we could not agree on any. And so I do agree that banning all posts by weapons manufacturers would be more consistent. I would rather solve this problem by allowing all weapons manufacturers' job posts (that are otherwise in good standing). |

| Robert  | ✅ |👍 On delisting and rejecting defense contractors.<br><br>- It does not benefit this highly international project and community.<br>-Drains community energy and decision making capacity. Focus on the community, its infrastructure and its projects. |
| Tom  | ❌️ | Be consistent.<br><br>My preference order:<br>- allow both: Our policy for job postings from defense contractors should be okay. And that we should have so many non-defense contractors that they get drowned out. This is a policy change that is larger than this one post and might need to be discussed further.<br>- disallow both: While it is a tumultuous time with regards to global politics, US and Germany are still allies; thus if we ban/allow one or the other it would be a referendum on non-military matters, which is even more out of scope for us to adjudicate than the straight-up MIC consideration. This stance is at least consistent and predictable.<br>- allow this specific Helsing post: While I think they should be allowed, it should be consistent with our policy overall. Picking and choosing leads to more debate, contention, and distracts everyone in the project even more. I don't recommend this. I wouldn't want to use this "more palatable to some sensibilities" defense contractor to sneak in a change to policy. Be explicit if policy is changing. |
