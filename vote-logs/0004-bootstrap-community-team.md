# Vote #4: Proposal to bootstrap a "community team" with the help of alumni moderators

**Opened:** <2025-12-05> by Luj **Closed:** <2025-12-08> **Status:** ✅ Accepted

**Proposal:**

> In order to restore trust between the stakeholders of the moderation in the NixOS community, we enter in an interim period lasting until the end of April 2026. The broad objectives of this interim period are to:
> - build a new community team
> - reach a mutual agreement on the moderation philosophy and the overall direction of the NixOS community
> - (if possible) heal conflicts between SC and Moderation
>
> The actors of this interim phases will be:
> - The SC
> - A team of voluntary Alumni moderators (drafted from the team that resigned and from earlier teams) called the bootstrap team
> - If needs be, a mediator
>
> The roles of the actors will be:
> - For the bootstrap team, to perform the day to day business of moderation
> - For the bootstrap team, to source appropriate candidates to join the new community team
> - For the SC, to approve the final team proposed by the alumni moderators
> - For the SC + bootstrap team, to **reach an agreement** on a moderation philosophy for the NixOS community.
> - For the SC + bootstrap team, to **reach an agreement** on future relations between SC and community team, such as oversight mechanisms.
> - If needed, for the mediator to help bootstrap team + SC to reach agreement on both points above.
>
> Additionally:
> - The SC does not intervene directly into the sourcing of candidates for the permanent team, but it may impose constraints on the composition of the final team, such as geographic representativity for example.
> - The SC is not to intervene into day to day business of moderation, even during the interim period
> - All stakeholders agree to do their best to allow the community to have a permanent moderation before the end of April 2026
> - Both SC and bootstrap team may unilaterally put an end to the interim period if they estimate that reaching a state of agreement is impossible, putting an end to the moderation duty of the bootstrap team.
>
> The proposal addresses the immediate need for new moderators, and also open the way for a longer process where trust can be rebuilt between all the stakeholders of the moderation, and where meaningful changes can be obtained through collaboration.

| cafkafk  | ❌️ | I reject this proposal. The call for moderators should be open to the community, not picked by us. It's a non-meritocratic and nepotistic way to create a moderation team, and given the last team failed, I find the idea of creating a new team picked by the one that previously resigned to be a non starter. I insist that making the call open would not slow down the process either. |

| Philip | ✅ | I support this proposal as a path forward. It's measured and realistic. That said, there are six ways I can see that we might fail to accomplish our aims.<br><br>**A "recruitment void" due to alumni & SC burnout**<br>The proposal assumes that a sufficient number of Alumni moderators are willing and able to return. It's possible the reality is that these individuals are not interested in pouring themselves into a project they don't believe in. Furthermore, the SC members who bore the greatest brunt of community rage (rage, I must note, I contributed to) might initially agree to help, but returning to the line of fire during a high-conflict interim period could lead to immediate attrition. I fear the "Bootstrap Team" might start strong but deplete rapidly before April 2026, forcing the SC to intervene (violating the "non-intervention" clause) or leaving the community unmoderated.<br><br>**Deadlock on actual team approval**<br>Suppose we, the SC, can agree on goals and processes. What's happening above in this thread gives me hope that we can. However, we can still deadlock if candidates are proposed and rejected in loops, running out the clock until April without a confirmed permanent team. In my view, there is not a very deep bench here.<br><br>**Bandwidth saturation**<br>How do we ensure philosophy isn't ignored for daily ticket crunching? Suppose the Bootstrap Team handles the daily queue fine, but the high-level negotiations on "Philosophy" stall. These are very big questions, and as we've seen this month, it's easy for deliberation to grind to a halt without clear next steps. If April 2026 arrives and the work is done but no "Constitution" is signed, the interim period expires with the permanent team seated but operating without an agreed-upon rulebook. This puts us in a "common-law" situation, which I expect will end in another explosive event over some broader political trigger.<br><br>**Premature detonation**<br>Can we require a cooling-off period before the 'Kill Switch' is pulled? Lord knows we're all humans. Time zones and lack of sleep are real factors. I am deeply disappointed at how events in October went. I went to sleep on Saturday, spent Sunday sabbathing, and woke on Monday to a disaster zone of folks calcified into enemies—a situation where I believe they could have been collaborators had there been a cooling-off period. Maybe this is wishful thinking, but it feels necessary.<br><br>**Steering without steering**<br>I'd really like to empower the community team to articulate and perform the norms that will lead to a flourishing space. Yet in the discussions I've read so far, there's a deep suspicion between even the members of the SC—let alone the broader community—on specific folks' ability to do that. When there's suspicion, the SC or specific SC members will be very tempted to backchannel, micromanage specific decisions, or fixate on specific outcomes to the detriment of the larger job of steering and direction setting.<br><br>**Stupid politics things**<br>The world is volatile right now. We could easily get into a tussle about something that's not at all related to Nix specifically, but does relate to things that we hold near and dear. Collaboration ceases because we've discovered a "[scissor statement](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/)" that divides us, rather than a "glue statement" that binds us together despite differences. |
