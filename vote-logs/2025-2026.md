| cafkafk  | ✅ | We keep getting messages about flakes not being stabilized, and my efforts to push this issue seems to be met with various attempts at stalling. It is my belief that regardless of how we phrase it, de facto, flakes are a stable, if imperfect feature, used everywhere, and a major selling point of Nix. I think we should move immediately to declaring flakes stable and shipping them as such. I don't think there are any valid reasons to delay any longer, it is a constant source of harm on the project, and it doesn't win us anything other than mistrust and reputational harm. |
| John  | ❌️ |  I am -1 on this right now, because the libfetchers and other flakes code is bad that we cannot tell what it does. I want to fix it first --- not change the feature, but change the implementation so we at least know what "bad, v1 flakes" are. It shouldn't take that long --- the years that have gone by is not indicative of the amount of labor required. |

| Luj  | Abstain | I don’t think it is for the SC to make that call. There are technical barriers before we can call flakes stable, and the experts on the matter are the Nix team. I am happy to revisit the topic when the Nix team assessment is that flakes are stable and they require political support from the SC. |
| Robert  | ❌️ | Declaring something stable does magically finish it. Outcomes of the experiment: flakes are desirable, but partially implemented with significant tech debt. Community feedback needs to be addressed. Users are unhappy about the pace in which this happens. Support the development instead of freezing it in a way that can not be maintained. Declaring flakes "accepted" could perhaps be discussed. |
| Tom  | ❌️ |  I'm still not sure what the concrete proposal is. As it stands I'm a "no", but more due to not being clear on what is proposed. I suspect we are in some agreement in spirit. |

## Vote #2: approving constitutional change about no-confidence votes when some seats are vacant ([PR #181](https://github.com/NixOS/org/pull/181))

| cafkafk  | ✅ | I already approved it, and had my concerns addressed before being elected. I also [promised I would support this](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/472#issuecomment-3361605445) as part of the election. |
| John  | ❌️ |  Hoping we can find a different change that is unanimous. Also believe there are unresolved technical questions about what to do when there is simultaneously a 3/3 deadlock for no confidence and a 3-3 deadlock for holding a special election to replace a missing member. |
| K900  |✅  |  |
| Luj  | ✅ | The change restores the spirit of the vote of no confidence when some seats are vacant. |
| Robert  | ✅ | Overall governance culture is what defines success, but this backstop helps avoid unnecessary deadlock in the worst case. [See elaboration of political context regarding my delay]( https://github.com/NixOS/org/pull/181#pullrequestreview-3465253631) |
| Tom  | ❌️ | I am currently against this motion: my rationale from https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/472#issuecomment-3384089963 is still a weakly-held opinion in favor of the status quo. I am not convinced that there was an insurmountable crisis, nor that such a tweak is beneficial. I am being deliberately conservative with constitutional changes; especially with the flurry of proposals in the past few months. |
| Philip | ✅ | This change eliminates a real life deadlock that caused the previous SC to lose a significant amount of legitimacy. We should fix this specific case with this thoughtful, measured amendment. |
