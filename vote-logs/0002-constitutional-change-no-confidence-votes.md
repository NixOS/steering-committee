| Member | Vote | Rationale |
|:--------|:-----:|:----------|
| cafkafk  | ✅ | I already approved it, and had my concerns addressed before being elected. I also [promised I would support this](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/472#issuecomment-3361605445) as part of the election. |
| John  | ❌️ |  Hoping we can find a different change that is unanimous. Also believe there are unresolved technical questions about what to do when there is simultaneously a 3/3 deadlock for no confidence and a 3-3 deadlock for holding a special election to replace a missing member. |
| K900  |✅  |  |
| Luj  | ✅ | The change restores the spirit of the vote of no confidence when some seats are vacant. |
| Robert  | ✅ | Overall governance culture is what defines success, but this backstop helps avoid unnecessary deadlock in the worst case. [See elaboration of political context regarding my delay]( https://github.com/NixOS/org/pull/181#pullrequestreview-3465253631) |
| Tom  | ❌️ | I am currently against this motion: my rationale from https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/472#issuecomment-3384089963 is still a weakly-held opinion in favor of the status quo. I am not convinced that there was an insurmountable crisis, nor that such a tweak is beneficial. I am being deliberately conservative with constitutional changes; especially with the flurry of proposals in the past few months. |
| Philip | ✅ | This change eliminates a real life deadlock that caused the previous SC to lose a significant amount of legitimacy. We should fix this specific case with this thoughtful, measured amendment. |
