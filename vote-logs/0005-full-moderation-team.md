# Vote #5: A first sketch of a full moderation team

**Opened:** <2025-12-05> by cafkafk **Closed:** <2025-12-10> **Status:** ❌️ Rejected

**Proposal:**

> We need to stop trying to form moderation teams based on "I know a good person", and create an actual list of competences and values that we want. Then we need to do an open call for candidates. Then we need to use an interview with the sole intent of derisking the candidates being disingenuous.
>
> That will be the shortest, most long term sustainable path to a moderation team. And having a publicly voted rubric will mean that we're transparent to the community about what we're looking for, and can be held accountable and benchmarked against our ability to recruit those people.
>
> My concrete proposal is this:
>
> - We use the external guidance from <redacted> and use that to set up moderation values we should seek in our recruiting. We do that in a follow-up vote on the moderation value and competences we want.
> - We post to the moderation matrix room, as well as the NixOS discourse, with a call for moderators. Initially, we seek a maximum of 3 candidates, with a deadline by the end of January, so that we don't fill up the entire team initially. We then follow up with a second call in April.
> - Until the end of January we interview potential candidates with one round, with the sole goal of derisking their experience. If we trust them to fulfill their duties adequately, we add them to the moderation team.
>
> The point of not filling up the team is that we may learn a lot about recruiting moderators during our first call for moderators. This will inform us the second time, as well as with the experience of the first batch of moderators.
>
> Later, we should do these call for moderators with a regular cadence, to ensure that we're always adequately staffed, but that should be an issue for a separate vote.

| K900  | ❌️ | Extremely disagree on letting people volunteer for this, as I've said before, the people that volunteer are the worst people to have in this position |
| Luj  | ❌️ |  I have stated this before, in my opinion the SC should not carry the recruitment of new moderators for 3 main reasons:<br> - We are not fit to evaluate the soft skills needed to be a good moderators, only one of us has actual experience carrying moderation duty<br>- This is going to turn into a evaluation of each candidate politics with everyone trying to steer the composition towards their conception to a politically diverse moderation team<br>-Acting one again unilaterally will not get this new team the approval of the community |

| Philip | ❌️ | I agree with K900. I oppose the volunteer aspect. I like Luj's proposal significantly better, and hope that he'll make an updated one soon, as he said he would at our last meeting. |
