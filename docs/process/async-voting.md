# Async Decision Making Process

- Start a thread titled `Vote: <subject>`.
- Use 👍 or 👎 reactions as formal votes. Optionally add `Rationale:` to thread.
- The vote formally closes after 5 days. Not voting constitutes abstention.
- The vote initiator must specify the exact closing date and time in the vote announcement.
- The vote can close as soon as enough votes are cast to determine a clear outcome (accept/reject).
- Vote results are added to vote log thread, with `Rationale:`, unless material is confidential.

The decision to implement this process was ratified at 17:08 UTC, 2025-11-12 in the Steering Committee Zulip channel.
